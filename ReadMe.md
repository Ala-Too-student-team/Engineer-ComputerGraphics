## Name of the project: SoundBox2.0
 Short Description: Device that is similar to musical instrument which produces notes while pushing buttons.
 Automatic musical instrument represented as a box which produces musical notes (‘do re mi fa sol la si’).	 
 
## Main goal is: 
  1) provide good emotions and experience for beginners
  2) prepare to play on the piano
  3) improve skills

 ## Components
The scheme consists of:
battery (9 V)
8 pushButtons
Timer
Resistors 
Piezo Element
 
## The way it works
The Timer(555 microscheme) is used to work with siren. This is the way Piezo Element produces the sound. 
Contact from the buttons passes through resistors. Resistors have different resistance, so there is a difference in electric current which is power supplement for Piezo element, that is why the sound produced is different from each other.

ATTENTION! In order to make good quality pictures we imported the model created in OpenScad to Blender and took pictures of the SoundBox2.0 there.
